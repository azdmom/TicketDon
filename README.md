## Application's Purpose

  It is often difficult for those less fortunate to take part in culturally enriching activities such as art shows, concerts, the ballet, or the Opera due to the high financial cost of attending such events. Children and the elderly in inner cities rarely ever get to attend such events unless they are participating in a class trip or other sponsored activity. Likewise, people who have paid for tickets sometimes have things come up last minute and those event tickets often go to waste. By donating tickets that will otherwise go unused through The TicketDon, we aim to bridge this gap and broaden access to the arts to all people.
